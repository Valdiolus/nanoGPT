Gas prices could fall below $4 per gallon by late October, analyst says

Europe energy supply ‘in a very tight spot’ amid record-breaking heat wave

"I think you're going to see supply upended at the end of the year, if not before," Truist's Neal Dingmann says, adding: "I do think... that if trade flows and price caps happen... there's a very good chance for some price spikes in oil."  
U.S. refiners’ profits have benefitted from limited refining capacity, but soaring gasoline prices have started to push drivers off the road  
Some of the hottest weather on record is lifting natural-gas prices, reversing last month’s plunge and reviving a key driver of inflation

Just in: The European Central Bank has raised interest rates by a half percentage point — its first increase for more than a decade — while pledging to prevent rising borrowing costs from sparking a eurozone debt crisis amid political turmoil in Italy  
Although western financial support has increased since May, Kyiv is still counting on Ukraine's central bank to buy its debt by selling foreign reserves or printing money, at the risk of setting off an inflationary spiral  
A half-percentage-point interest rate rise by the BoE would be the largest since 1995  
European Central Bank policymakers will this week discuss the possibility of raising interest rates by half a percentage point, exceeding their own guidance and most economists’ expectations  
As the European Central Bank prepares for its first rate rise in 11 years, president Christine Lagarde must confront fears of a looming recession  
Italy still needs Mario Draghi  
The Federal Reserve is under pressure to abandon its monetary policy guidance for the second month in a row in the face of soaring inflation  
How much additional tightening—and this is the important part—will be required depends on a number of factors that fall outside of the Fed's direct control." @MaryDalyEcon spoke on tightening policy beyond neutral in her recent speech at @ChapmanArgyros:  
.@BlackRock Head of @iShares Investment Strategy @Gargi_Chaudhuri on the Fed: “If they’re telling us they are going to take the funds rate a lot past neutral and going to be excessively restrictive, I think that probably poses some downside risk for the equity market.”  
“The Fed needs to move… quickly,” Teton Capital CEO David Sokol says. “I think in hindsight it would’ve been better to see 75 basis points at their first move. … The louder the message that the Fed’s serious, the better.  
“It’s been a decade since we’ve had a recession,” Sanders Morris Harris Chairman George Ball says. “They happen now and then. It’s not the Fed’s job to keep us out of a recession, nor can they forever.”  
.@GoldmanSachs CEO @DavidSolomon on inflation: “The economic conditions need to get tighter to break the back of inflation. I think the Fed is focused on it… and hopefully, we'll see some balance in this as they move in that direction.”  
“We’re definitely seeing the odds now looking increasingly more towards a 100 bps [rate] hike,” @monetagroup CIO @AoifinnDevitt says. “We’re seeing no sign of any softening in terms of inflation.”  
The Fed should “communicate with the public that there’s only so much that they can do, especially for near-term inflation relief,” Allspring Global Investments Senior Investment Strategist Brian Jacobsen says. “Food costs and fuel costs — the Fed can’t do much about that.”  
Why the Fed won't raise interest rates by 100bps next week, according to Goldman Sachs  
Shock inflation data may push Fed towards historic rate increase: Strategist  
Bank of America slashes stock market forecast, calls for 'mild recession' this year  
The Fed’s “going to hike interest rates until they can break the back of inflation,” @rwbaird Strategy Analyst Ross Mayfield says on the possibility of a 75-100 bps rate hike. “The market expects the Fed and other forces to conspire to a recession in the U.S.”  
How big an interest rate hike do you think the Fed will make at its upcoming meeting?
“Housing is the most interest rate-sensitive sector of the economy,” @economics_ma's @Markzandi says. “The Fed is raising interest rates to slow growth, and that’s going to work first and foremost through a weaker housing market.”  
"We certainly have a Fed that seems to be leaning against further strengthening the economy," @BankofAmerica Head of U.S. Economics Michael Gapen says. "In general, conditions are pretty solid right now in U.S. labor markets and the overall economy."  
“They don't want to be the central banks that gave us another 1970s,” @abrdn_US Senior Global Economist James McCann says on the Fed and other countries' rate hikes. “What we're seeing across the board is a preparedness to move pretty quickly to get that done.”  
“In less than 4 months, we've seen 175 basis points of rate increase,” @DeutscheBank Wealth Management's Deepak Puri says. “Normally for us to have that kind of a rate hike, it would normally take 18 to 24 months — it took us almost 18 months for us to get to that level.”  
“What the Fed is really attempting do at this point in time is to engineer sort of a soft landing or find the middle ground between an acceptable level of inflation and less sort of pain in the overall economy,” @ArielInvests Vice President Danan Kirby says. Full interview:  
For St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard, when it comes to the current yield-curve inversion, it’s a case of “this time is different”  
Fed officials have signaled they are likely to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point at their next meeting to combat high inflation   
Economists increasingly expect the Fed, in its efforts to push down inflation, to raise rates enough to trigger a recession  
The Dutch central bank fined cryptocurrency exchange Binance for offering services without proper registration  
The investigating agency also cited some oversights in the central bankers’ market activities  
Fed governor Christopher Waller says he’d favor a 0.75-percentage-point rate rise at the central bank’s meeting in two weeks—though economic data between now and then could tip the scale in favor of an increase of a full percentage point  
Senators say a formal system is needed to deal with any violations by Fed officials

Fresh evidence of accelerating inflation rattled bond markets anew, sending traders rushing to prepare for more aggressive interest-rate increases.  
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George is concerned that monetary policy tightening may be happening more quickly than the economy and financial sector can absorb  
Americans expect lower inflation increases over the longer run, amid a sharp drop in projected home-price increases, the New York Fed said

@VolatilityVIX Reasonable point as Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, and Bryson DeChambeau are big names.  But I think it's fair because of the announced participants, NONE is in the top 15 in world rankings.  Louis Oosthuizen, Sergio, Westwood, Mickelson, Poulter, Henrik Stenson, Howell III?
I'm starting to think the PGA's approach to the LIV tour is all wrong.  They're making a bunch of second-tier or has-been pro golfers who everyone has forgotten about into loveable rebels who are giving the finger to "the man," and getting rich(er) doing it.  Thoughts?

The complete descent of Apollo 11 from 53 years ago today.  It's fascinating.   
53 years ago today we landed a person on the moon for the very first time.  Fewer than 22 years before that we broke the sound barrier for the first time.    And it was less than 66 years from the Wright brothers first flight to landing on the moon.  The pace amazes me.
I'll never understand why people record videos while sitting in their car.

Sadly, Jeri's was one of the very first casualties of the pandemic.  I used to take my Sunday paper there and sit at the counter.  It was a great place and it's a real loss.
I wasn't trying to be a smart ass.  This is the formula that Formula 1 racing is using to calculate the amount of "porpoising" experienced by race cars.    I posted it because I'm amazed at the technical complexity of Formula 1 cars.
When did the Univ. of Michigan football team breakout into riding the Tour de France?   
Bonus points if you can tell me what this formula is intended to calculate.  
Who are the top academics working in the financial history space?

So levered single-stock ETFs are okay but volatility products using most liquid option contracts (SPY) in the world are not? @HesterPeirce   Investors in U.S. have a new way to supersize bets on high-profile stocks, with the launch of single-stock ETFs   
History may not repeat itself but it rhymes.  I've been told this DIDN'T come from Mark Twain, as I've written it did, and I'm chastened.    But it's still valid and it's important to remember.

@JoeDubyk Good point but the Apple ecosystem is self reinforcing.  I don't think that's the case with Tesla.  Each EV is a stand alone product, and some are better than Tesla.  Mercedes has better range, the EV Mustang is a much better value, etc.  Buyers switch automakers all the time.

I haven't read the book yet (Sorry Mary).  My most vivid memory of Bill Gross is from early 2000s when I was in the treasury bond option pit at the CBOT.  Bill sold option strangles until he killed the pit.  I mean he sold so many that he destroyed nearly every market maker there
@Phil_Lewis_ It's the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Steve has a really interesting take.
Formula 1 driver, “I’m on fire. I’d like to stop.”
Unfortunately, none of those new jobs are airline pilot, flight attendant, baggage handler, gate agent, or air traffic controller.
@ResearchRonin Pretty big risk but who knows. Maybe they went to local authorities who gave them a tentative “thumbs up”?  I bet it’s a hell of a boat. And I’m more of a plane guy than a boat guy.

Adjusted for inflation, CFOs do not expect their revenues to grow on average in 2022, down from expected real revenue growth of approximately 3% in last quarter’s survey:  
CFOs also expected price pressures to worsen for 2022. The median CFO expectation last quarter was for a 6% increase in their unit costs for 2022; this quarter the expectation was an 8% increase in costs: 
“Price pressures have increased, real revenue growth has stalled &amp; optimism about the overall economy has fallen sharply,” said John Graham, a Fuqua finance professor &amp; the survey’s academic director. “Monetary tightening is one of several factors dampening the economic outlook.”
According to the most recent results of #TheCFOSurvey, a collaboration of @DukeFuqua, @RichmondFed and @AtlantaFed, CFO views on the economy have worsened for 2022:

US PRESIDENT BIDEN: U.S. JUNE INFLATION DATA IS 'UNACCEPTABLY HIGH,' BUT ALSO OUT OF DATE GIVEN RECENT DROP IN GASOLINE PRICES ----&gt; exactly what i said previously ....
"The increase was broad-based, with the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food being the largest contributors". Oil is in free fall..... CPI will follow ....
CPI has peaked !!! FED knows that ......
$SPY $SPX CPI is losing momentum...... CPI at 9.1% is bad , but not a catastrofy .... with Oil falling hard, next CPI numbers will be well below 7 imho
CPI below estimates ..... everybody was thinking abv 10
$SPX Everybody is worried wit the CPI numbers, but probably will be slightly better than expected. Just a guess
the U.S. could face another round of inflationary pressures and supply chain issues as we face trucking disruptions in California even as unions and West Coast port employers are negotiating a new labor contract.  
Today, all eyes turn to what the June Producer Price Index tells us about inflation.  
Today's 9.1% CPI negated all of the prevalent "inflation has peaked" posts going into today. Core (which doesn't include food &amp; energy) was up M/M. Most peak inflation posts that I see assume that when CPI &amp; PCE tick down, that the Fed will stop - that probably won't be the case.  
@AsennaWealth CPI is probably higher tomorrow vs last month. Jobs data came in strong. I’d expect them to stay aggressive.
@sonatervj Futures market pricing in 3.25 to 3.50 EOY, from 1.50/1.75 now. High inflation and strong NFP won't help the Fed pause narrative. This data changes quickly and a lot can change by the Sept Fed meeting, but CPI this week might come in higher than many expect.

U.S. jobless claims rise to highest level since last November  
U.S. wholesale prices surge again and signal inflation is still running hot  
U.S. producer-price index climbs more than forecast in June  
European Commission hikes inflation forecast  
OPINION: As the year-over-year pace for the Consumer Price Index rose to 9.1%, this is not a time for the Federal Reserve to stick its neck out and take a chance by slowing its rate hikes early, economist Robert Brusca writes.   
When the 0.3% monthly increase in average hourly earnings takes the latest CPI data into account, wages fell by 1% on the month.   
As the U.S. annualized inflation rate hit a 41-year record of 9.1%, Social Security recipients may see cost-of-living adjustments to their checks next year like never before.   
The biggest monthly rent increase in 36 years is adding fuel to the inflation fire  
Real average hourly earnings contracted 3.6% year-over-year, paired against a 9.1% annualized inflation rate in June.   
China’s commodities imports might be close to a bottom, but demand remains soft, says economist  
The U.S. is on track to post the first annual deficit below $1 trillion since the start of the pandemic two and a half years ago.   
Rent prices are helping to fuel inflation, new government data shows, seeing their largest monthly increase in more than three decades.   The national median monthly asking rent passed $2,000 for the first time in May, according to data from Redfin.  
Even after factoring in the drop in gas prices, CPI fixings traders still expect a 8.6% CPI reading for July, 8.3% for August, and 8.2% for September.   
Rent prices are helping to fuel inflation, new government data shows, seeing their largest monthly increase in more than three decades.   It’s unclear that tenants will get relief in the near term — which could make it more difficult to curb inflation.  
Biden touts falling gas prices, but it’s no cure for high inflation  
The Biden administration made an effort to address the high reading for consumer prices before it even came out. The June CPI data “will largely not reflect the substantial declines in gas prices we’ve seen since the middle of June,” a memo said.  
The yearly inflation rate hit 9.1% in June. Worker wages aren’t keeping up with price increases — real hourly wages have fallen 3.1% in the past year.   
Surging gas prices last month drove the rate of U.S. inflation to a nearly 41-year peak of 9.1%, offering little hope of help soon for Americans suffering from a high cost of living.  
The June CPI data “will largely not reflect the substantial declines in gas prices we’ve seen since the middle of June,” because that data “captures the average price over the course of a month,” said a memo from two top White House economic officials.  
Biden calls June inflation reading ‘unacceptably high’ if ‘out of date’  
Biden says inflation reading 'unacceptably high,' but 'also out-of-date'  
The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for U.S. growth for the second time in two months, citing the increasingly difficulty of sidestepping inflation, compounded by the lingering COVID pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  
White House calls attention to falling gas prices not reflected in June CPI data  
Core reading shows annualized U.S. inflation rate dipping below 6% in June  
June CPI data show U.S. annual inflation rate topping 9%  
Coming up: CPI data to update the U.S. retail inflation picture  
The increase in inflation over the past year is forecast to climb to 8.8% from 8.6% — and is unlikely to cool off much anytime soon.   
Heads up: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday that a release circulating online purporting to show June inflation data, due for release on Wednesday morning, was a forgery.   
Brace for a high June inflation reading — but the surge so far hasn’t led to ‘unanchored’ expectations, says BlackRock  
The report for the consumer price index is expected to show a year-over-year rise of 8.8% for June, according to economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.  
The Biden administration played defense before a much-anticipated reading on raging U.S. inflation, with officials holding a briefing for reporters and releasing a memo that they said “provides context for the upcoming CPI report.”

#SPX daily - Prior FOMC meetings resulted in a relief rally. Notice how the higher low provided the hint that a bounce was to play out after FOMC. Will history repeat later today? 4300 resistance then 4400 area. Notice how rallies were eventually sold into. Critical 4060 holds

AMZN GOOGL both strong reversal today, nflx FB not bad... gonna be another interesting week next week.... have a great weekend all twitter friends!!
Nflx super strong reversal
We destroyed FB nflx but missed Googl though ..... AMZN weaker 1951 is key otherwise just premium killing
It’s been quite a while since we saw FAANG all setting up well....
$LI is now consolidating for three weeks in a tight flag after a 120% up move in seven weeks off the bottom.   Watch for a break above this descending trend line and through the top of the flag at 41.49.  
$CELH clears a short flag or a low handle at 80.35 on heavy volume as it works on the right side of a large consolidation.  
$SWAV clears the descending trend line of a large consolidation and the 200 Century Mark on light volume.  RS line is at a new high.  
$HALO reclaims the cup with handle / flat base pivot of 48.58 after finding support at the 21-day EMA. It shows accumulation with 6 consecutive up weeks and blue skyscrapers within the base.  
$UTHR shook out and reversed higher after testing the flag high / high handle pivot of 236.06.  
$VRTX has been consolidating in a tight range for 3 weeks now just below the 300 Century Mark.  It closed just above the 292.75 left side high of its base.  Weekly RS line is at a new high.  
Watch List, 7/17: $VRTX $UNH $UTHR $HALO $SWAV $LNTH $CELH $LI  Charts courtesy of @MarketSmith
@Stock_Inf0 Yep.
$ABBV stop hit. The trade closed lost right near $5 a share.  Not all trades work. Next.
$MSFT  I do own shares in this name. no chart posted when buought
$GOOGL daily back over and holding a confluence of MA's. Indicators are reset and ready if price wants higher. ER next week. (position)
$WMT daily chart trying to break higher out to the base and gap area. Indicators reset and ready if price wants higher. I put a volume by price bar on this chart to show overhead supply.  I know many who hold/trade this name  
$NKE  updated chart daily back over 50ma 10/21ma bull cross. RSI back over 50 MACD turning up  
$NVDA updated chart.  Now that price is over the 50ma I am watching the June gap. RSI back over 50.  10/21ma bull cross.  Chart looking better  
$XBI daily another base break higher  
$NVDA back over yesterday high.   Going to take my paydays soon
The day is good when @HCPG  is in my stream and posting charts.  TY
$NVDA never did sell my payday shares yesterday I am watching close again today to take them off and get down to swing size
$QCOM close to being able to put some into let it ride.  It just hit the day high list again.  No action taking on my holding at this time
top 4 ETF's from a list I watch right now = $SMH $XBI $XRT $XOP
$HAS boring name but showing some dumpster dive potential. ER behind the name with good response.  Ex-date soon. I took on a position today.  
@pawan1234o @Ed_Hale @johnscharts @ClutchBP @Striff17 @trijoey $AMZN confirmed ER 7-28 after the close
$XLE today's new trade I have put in a break even or make a little coin stop.
@daveBer05277367 END of day only wouldn't want yesterday low to be lost.  Intraday if planning on a swing have to give it room.  Or you can be quick to raise your stop to no green to red and see what happens.  ATR (14) daily = 2.82 Trade your plan not my noise
$XLE strong off the open (position)
$AAPL stop hit all out of the remainder of the trade made great coin.  Name goes back on go to list/watch
$SPY H1 chart lately one could trade the RSI 70/30 been great clue to be short or long. Observation at this time flat on SPY at this time
$AAPL bracket order hit for a rung of the ladder made good loot. Still own shares
$AFRM with a gap up triangle base break up and out today. None here.  Seems I saw the chart in @traderstewie stream recently.
For me and my position on $NVDA the big level on watch 176.97-177 area.  All in time.  Right now I am watching the 50ma daily then 168.69, 171 area, 173 area.
$NVDA has an ATR (14) daily currently $8.49 it is up over $10 on the day. (holding it here).  Price made an attempt over 50ma and is battling it now
$SMH top 5 holdings $TSM $NVDA $TXN $QCOM $INTC  Now this one I was right on a few of them and I do own some of them
$XRT top 5 holdings $CHWY $GO $OLLI $RAD $DG  surprised me, how about you?
$XRT currently has 101 holdings in this ETF. If I asked you to name the top 5 holdings could you?  I couldn't was surprised when I looked at the list. $COST is #7  I will list the top 5 next
$WMT 130.64 is gap fill and 131.35 confirms. Daily chart
$SMH watching $218.81, 220.44 the 50ma daily then June 10 low 223.42.  Trading an ETF keeps ER season a bit easier, spreading risk and don't have to sell if not a let it ride.
Looking to take my payday shares off on $NVDA today.  watching it
$AMZN back to the 116-116.10 area. I am watching same levels I gave last week.  Still holding it here
top sector ETF's right now $XOP $XME $XLE $XRT  (I own some or individual names within the sector)
$AMZN until the 15 and 30 min charts base this is going to be hard to get more from it. Not a lot of time left in the day. My opinion, your wallet and trade plan.
Perfect example when I gave short term levels for $AMZN I was thinking if it gets to 115.23 that will probably be it. Then next level was 115.54 and 115.60. So far high of day 115.59.  Don't tell price where it is going let it show you.  Watch the candles they light our path
Folks I have a swing trade on $AMZN just having fun with the lower time frame charts.  To entertain and teach
$AMZN the 15/30 min chart is stretched and going to need basing soon
Now we have our 115.54 $AMZN  if day trading one can inch up the stop / ladder some or wait for the next candle to light your way.
$AMZN current daily ATR (14) is $5.09
Just for fun if we stay with the AMZN 30 min chart we can watch 115.54 once 115.23 holds convincingly.  then 115.60, 115.75  and the 116.10 bigger picture/time frame
$AAPL is all about the 150 level imo
I am having fun giving levels I am watching.  Also seeing other traders I have a lot of respect for posting levels on $AMZN.  Thanks to all
$AMZN a 30 min chart shows the 115.23 level clearly.
$AMZN made our 115 the number watching the most for me is June 9 low of day 116.10.  If look at an H1 chart 115.23 is next
Some names reporting next week. price over $20 trade 1 million or more shares a day  
Names that reported ER in the previous 5 days with price over $20 and trade 1 million shares or more a day.  Sector and industry included.  
$AMZN levels on my radar if price wants higher A hold over 114.30, 115ish and then the June 9 lod = 116.10 former gap area. (full swing position here)
$WMT into the May 18 gap daily.  Not a great stick so far for a break out of a base.  The close is what counts.
$MSFT with a gap and go stick on the daily. Back over 10/21 next up is the 50ma.  (position today)
$ABBV still in the base. Gap up today over the 50/100ma. Also note the bull cross 21/50ma RSI holding 50. This name went ex-dividend yesterday.  
$AMZN took my payday shares off with the gap up made $4 a share profit on this group now I settle into the full swing trade.
Hello stock fans.  Gap ups offer an opportunity to ladder some and / or inch up stops.
I am underwater on $ABBV but stop not hit. It did go ex-dividend today.
I did keep $COST and $QCOM trades.  posted charts etc earlier
$TSLA day trade taken off near the close.  It didn't reach the price I needed to swing it.  I made great $ and will look at it again tomorrow.
$QCOM bracket order hit on the payday shares. Made great coin. Now I settle into the full swing position and in time if all goes well let it ride.
$TSLA struggled at $700 then $704 next level up for me is 710.49
$AMZN red to green on the day (I do own this name)
$COST chart to go with all my yammering today  
$COST a beast of a day for this name. 200ma daily next on my radar.
Daily chart $QCOM  
SMH names on the move I own a few here.
$COST has reached its ATR(14) of 13.09. if thinking time to take payday shares, drop down time frames and stalk.
COST 505-506 area next level to watch IMO
$AAPL red to green (still holding it here)
$QCOM daily base breaking higher like to see 136.69 hold by days end.  Next short term level high I am watch 137.45 move and hold over.
$COST getting some lift.  I know many in this name
$GME been in day high list 3 days in a row.  None here observation.  Congrats if you took it
$QCOM worth a look (position)
@AltitudeChaz $COST and $QCOM too
$UUP hitting the 52 week high list. Observation
$ABBV posted chart and trade a few days back @alphatrends reminding us of the ex-dividend
Ty for info and chart holding it here and basically flat on the trade so far up a little
seeing names like $K $CL $PG $CPB in the high of day list.
$NVDA up base up base on the 5 min chart what I like to see when day trading. (position)  I am using the 5 and 15 min charts only at this time.
$MSFT finally coming off the lows (position day trade for now)  Safer entry is the reversal trade, watching 252.04
Top sector ETF's that I watch right now = $XOP $XLE $XBI
$NKE out most of the trade for a little over $2 a share profit.
Top holdings of XHB. Note not a pure 'homebuilders' ETF  
I am not a big fan of trading airline stocks or shiny metals.  JETS is one way to own a basket of airline stocks.   observation none here
a lot of change in the top sectors in one hour. XHB XRT XLP  leading right now
$NOC flag base on the daily with all the ma's lined up in bullish order. None here observation
$XHB was a top sector yesterday and again today
$PEP with a pullback and small bounce. @optionsprochick @AltitudeChaz  HT
$AAPL over the recent highs now watching 147.95 and of course the $150 area
Top green sectors at this time. $SMH $XLY $XHB
$NVDA end of day stop has me taking the trade off, made just shy of $5 a share profit.  Name goes back on watch and go to list.
$DUK in flag base daily. Indicators reset.  None in trade account at this time  ER first week of August.
$DHR nice high base daily. It is hitting its head on the 100ma.  ER soon.  A name from my go to list. No position at this time
$COST daily after many up days finally looking like it needs to base/pull in some.
$CL daily pulling back to a level of multiple moving averages. None in trade account own some in investment account.
$ABBV hitting the day high list. Chart posted early today
Back to underwater on $NUE stop not hit.
@canuck2usa hitting the 52 week high list  WTG  none here
$BOX coming out of a base on the daily chart. Observation
$NUE back to green on the trade.  Watching 111.95 a move and hold over by days end then maybe I have something with this trade. ER this month
$ABBV sitting in a high base 10ema/100ma holding as first support.  Watching for base break higher, clear stop.  
$GOOGL pushing here at the end of day. (still own it here)
Keep the June gaps on your radar, they won't be easy. $IWM $QQQ $SPY etc  H1/65 min charts need some work and basing would help
@Sundevil781 SPY and QQQ daily says no.
$SPX Jan. $2600 puts being sold to open 6000X for $14M premium collection
Picked up some $TSLA straddles late yesterday - thought I was doomed when flat A/H, but saw indicated above value (753) this morning so bull bias for move, closed put side on open, and now exited calls as gets near 800...able to turn a profit...love flexibility of options

Dug into $SMCI in May with an unusual trade and been accumulating shares, liked the story  
@TrdrCl If lose 625 then 500 comes into play
$AMD buyer here 4400 Aug 82 puts for $3.25
Interesting structured trades in $DOCU $COUP today where you buy Jan. 2023 higher Delta calls and sell Jan. 2024 lower Delta calls at net credit, tends to be a structure to use to bet on M&amp;A (as a deal would capture upside and the OTM lose premium)
QQQ high today was just under VWAP from early April rally reversal
@bottomsniper99 Moved less than implied...calls lost value lmao
Gaming Leisure Properties $GLPI buyer 3400 January $55 calls $1.60 as Oct. 50 adjust  Name quietly been enfuego

Tesla $TSLA trading another 14,500 September $650/$550 put spreads where 5000 opened the other day ahead of earnings tonight  ...yes, spreads are often hedging long stock...take it w/ a grain of salt
$NFLX $4M in Oct 190 puts buying w/ Aug. 190's sold, seems like nice play to position for next report as biz trends weaken
Coinbase $COIN 1270 Aug. $67 puts opening $8.25 into strength, at potential fade spot
$BILL breaking out w/ Software names hot, tight B-Bands and out of monthly value, trend, room to 150's  
DDOG, SNOW, ZM - some big early moves in Software with Yields lower
$NFLX red already. reality set in, nice little short opp. last night
$NFLX giving back most of the post-earnings pop into the open, should be an interesting battle today
Hence those $CALM earnings  + Note out on $VITL today too
@papadox11 BIGC is hot garbage
$MNDY one of the ugliest can not even bounce in a mega rally name out there and still trades 6.6X EV/Sales with no profits in sight  
$NFLX see if this holds, missed revenues, weak operating margins, weak margin guide, less than 10% growth  Let that put play scare me out of our bull strategy for earnings at +60%
notable size buy 900 September $195 puts for $19.80 earlier as well
$BEAM opening sellers Aug 70 calls this afternoon, good strategy if rode this badboy long!
$CLFD another small cap that continues to work nicely
The PTSD from Q1/Q2 out there is real...stream was so bearish while all signs been there of money being put back to work $QQQ +7% in 2H22 already...following prediction that 2H is very diff. than 1H in 2022

Someone selling a ton of $SE puts to open Sep and Nov 60
$NKE strong early with 8/21 bull cross nearing, shook off earnings move lower well and has the 29K Oct 120/130 call spreads in OI
@NFTpfpPurchaser IBM results were solid, LMT were ugly - so yea, would still delineate between good./bad results being sold
@NFTpfpPurchaser Seeing most dips get bought after initial sell reactions though, likely because everyone capitulated ahead of earnings season
$SAVA also seeing Aug put buying
$NTLA $CRSP Aug. puts both hot late
Would you buy $META at $122.75?  If so, could sell Dec. 130 puts for 7.25 here like someone just did 1000X...this is how to look at things (and why really never makes sense to buy stocks as opposed to selling puts if liquidity is there...define your price)
France $EWQ spreads selling 3000 August $26 puts and buying the December $29 puts, ETF that does not see much action
$SPY faded off its 8-week EMA which has been a tough level, where we faded late June as well  55-MA for $QQQ
$SLVM rocking today  Another case where unusual options action led me to researching the catalyst, found this Atlas stake thing..and working well. banking my gains but prob. regret, could def. see a deal   Would have never known of this name w/ out my options scans  
$PTON 4500 Jan. 2024 $45 calls selling to open $0.50  They should be safe not getting exercised...but also, pretty crazy a $9 stock can sell $45 strike calls for $0.50
Lyft $LYFT buyers active October $15 calls 8000X for $1.5M where 9K bought Friday  Wonder if we see a $LYFT $DASH merger ?
Snap $SNAP buyers here 10.000 November $15 calls $2.56 offer into earnings later in the week
$AMZN buyers active for 10,000 October $145 OTM calls 1.45 to 1.50
Unusual Call Buy in Network Equipment Small Cap  
296/297 big spot for $QQQ then $300...but above that see room to 330 ~ YTD VWAP  
@BiotechMamba QQQ could see 330, VWAP off highs, if can close above 55-MA a few days
Randomly bought ETH yesterday morning, first crypto trade of 2022 - saw similar to what I am seeing in the Nasdaq w/ basing, key level (lifetime VWAP) etc. - nice start today!
The interesting thing here is the 200-week EMA is an inflection point for secular bear/bull, and is where $SPY $QQQ been building multi-week bases
@Buncahn @johnscharts Awesome company too, one of our top 2022 small caps, some background info from our write up

Bitcoin $BTC down 20K since my call in April, forming another weekly bear pennant recently, had seen 5K target, still possible, but 12K a likely bounce spot
$CBOE continues to work higher and through its 200-MA

Added $JAGX for the coming days (swing trade)

@sitiain66 I like ADN
$AEI This penny stock is starting to heat up. It had a vlm boost on Friday. Key momentum indicators are turning up. In the past has gotten very hot, and we could be seeing that again. Breakout watch over $.305 watch it closely. I took a position on Friday. PV1 44c  
$DMTK love the look of this chart. Flagging nicely here for a breakout move, which could be explosive. Breakout watch over 6.77  
$PYPL Looks like it is getting ready for a breakout soon. Im long  
$AEI holding for next week. The break of 0.305 should send it to 40c (bottom setup, swing add)
$VINO my position on this name also remains intact. From a fundamental standpoint, the company is undervalued and NO RS soon according to the recent filing.
$NEPT holding for next week.... i can wait.... chart looks perfect , just needs volume
$AEI loading up some for next week.... pennies are getting hot again and this one has a beautiful bottom chart. Swing add

@TradeOnTheWire1 im still holding TBLT ;) Other low floaters NEPT LGVN VLCN VINO IMTE
$VLCN cant find any reason for this pullback following a huge accumulation day...... the distribution volume has been very low.... $70M in pre-orders recently announced is superb news for the short term and increases my optimism.  
Impressive rally on $C  
As i said this morning, low float names are running one by one $TBLT is paying off today (i added recently), just like $NEPT will go, someone has been accumulating lately. Im holding a huge position now and im felling goo...  
$NEPT nothing has changed here.... sellers are losing momentum (ADX indicator) and the rounding bottom pattern remains intact.  
$VLCN cacthing some bids at open
$TBLT find the bottom setup and then is just chilling :) the money will come to you sooner or later…
$NEXI runner in afterhours
$TBLT active in AH
$NEPT i bot more today on the break of 1.55 and im good, still looking for a run to +$2 and beyond (closing gap). In this market, patience/trend is our friend
$NETP too many flippers here..... let them sell... the trend is our friend ...
$MULN trending
Huge reversal on markets, lets see if $DMTK breaks the 6.77 neckline for a nice short squeeze 15% of float is sold short
$VINO big buy block
$NEPT Flagging here for another leg up. Look at the volume accumulation over the past sessions...... once it breaks 1.62 next pv lies at 1.87 then 2.05 (gap zone). Chart speaks for itself.  
$TLRY any close abv 3.72 and the squeeze is ON  
$NEPT Good upside volume on the break of 1.55 .... at this point, the target is the gap zone as chart shows.... but bc its a low float name can easily fill the gap... patience is key now.... algos will make it  
$NEPT $PETZ low floats on the move !!!
$NEPT volume is coming in...... gonna squeeze imho
$NEPT buyers are stepping in .... The break of 1.55 could be explosive ... no resistances abv ... gap zone is too far

$DMTK adding this pullback for a breakout move.  
$AAPL continues making HOD
$NEPT Rounding bottom formation while money flow is rising. Setting up nicely for higher prices. Breakout watch over 1.55  
$VLCN This is very constructive price action as it pulls back on lighter volume. The massive volume accumulation remains intact (strong hands holding, weak hands selling)  
$NEPT let them sell us. Loading zone 1.41 previous resistance zone now support zone. Money flow is positive
$GME $AMC APES are back !!!
$NEPT bottomed out. As i always say, play what u see.....  
$VLCN calm b4 the storm….. it seems a message for shorts 😉 yesterday company tweet
$NEPT worth watching for continuation. Stock had a volume boost in the last hour of trading. As I said yesterday, with such a low float and extremely oversold, I would not be surprised with a $PETZ type-move.
Watch $NEPT over 1.55 (hod level) in afterhours for a run
$BTAI what a great close !!!!
$NEPT new HOD..... strong into the close..... gapper candidate
I would not be surprised with a $PETZ type-move on $NEPT low float play !!!

@smalltalkdaily TBS will be deleted from the MSCI EM index effective cob today. Expect big volumes in closing auction
@Deon71619531 @smalltalkdaily Possible but need to see what happens at 63k and 58k first. Drop to 54k implies S&amp;P500 around 3600 which would begin to line up with 50% retracement off covid lows
#ALSI future monthly highlighting 5 moves to the upside and now sideways to lower action. Seems sellers remain active into strength. 63k critical as break of this support targets 58k. Uptrend also being tested  
@ReneeSterckx @tradinglikeafox That is one the fundamental analysts I would imagine. I have technical target of R423 provided R340 holds
Disclosure: I'm not long tech or $QQQ here. I'm still short $SPX via $SH. I don't trade countertrend, below 50 + 200-sma, but I went into detail to let members know that $QQQ and tech had moved up in rankings and into a potential breakout mode.
I'm not in the 'bear market is over' camp yet. I have some longs and some shorts, but I think $NDX mega caps are better here relatively than most cyclicals (banks, industrials, materials). Earnings should tell a lot next week.
$QQQ trying to follow through &gt; 50-sma, into a key 300-315 overhead range. No position.  
@dshamanaman @I_MT978 Looks like $TWTR got it, thanks Dave!
@collegea I'm comparing $SPX to $SPX - exact same.
June 9, $SPX at 4090, expect a range breakout within the next week, around CPI/FOMC. $SPX broke down later that day, -9% in 3 days and 12% in 6 days from my alert.  
@churnerofmarket I’m short.

@AMikeCMoon It wasn't nonsense last month when $SPY and $QQQ dopped 12-13% after it.
@jarzt Much better for $TSLA though. Every minute he spent focused on the $TWTR deal was a minute not focused on $TSLA.

@kmj2190 I would exit shorts at this time. Market is wanting to squeeze.
Pretty much at that $30 target now   $AFRM  
There goes that $RBLX breakout  
@skrochta I don't see anything interesting in $kss yet
@MattOrigi6 $SHOP trying to bottom here
$RBLX keeps on coiling ... only a matter of time before this makes a big move, imo First target $45  
Man... this $MARA exploded   Check out those Accumulation Volume patterns. It added two more huge volume days this week!  
First $AFRM target is $30 to $32 area ... might get there before Friday at this rate of acceleration  
Let's see how "timely" this $NVDA shares purchase will be? Hmmm  
Keep an eye on this $RBLX   Feels like the next one that wants to explode higher. Squeeze potential building!  
@JohnGar57253771 $12 target is reasonable
From this list of 'Accumulation Volume' candidates... it's now $MARA's turn to take off 🚀 🚀   Note the mini bullish flag formed last week...  
Strong move here  $AFRM  
@ryanoneill64 A BOTTOM is in there... will be worth watching or playing a few names from that arena.   i.e. $RBLX or $AFRM setups shared earlier today
@RickyJ0914 $30
$RBLX ... impressive Accumulation Volume patterns given current market conditions but this one is a must watch next week especially on the days Nasdaq, $IWM are green or bouncing.  Notice how well it remained above breakout area and 20 day MA this week. Targets: $45 and then $50  
@TheMarathon8320 Yup. Love this $RBLX   One of my favorite long ideas
@SKP2692 Agree. Feels like it wants to go   Targets $25 and then $30 is reasonable given market conditions
@debraak Nice relative strength today.
@CashRocket And made a cool double bottom recently
@GraffVlogz Tough to call $shop here. I can't yet tell if it's trying to bottom or simply basing near lows ahead of new leg lower.
@mizuno6543 Strong momentum in SIGA. It's breaking out here so you gotta see if it continues to break out tomorrow or if it fails
$U ... I'd book those kinds of quick, sharp gains  
$U ... rolling over after a weak intra-day bounce attempt  
@kmj2190 $CF still struggling to get back above resistance levels... still watching as a Short.  
Still haven't started short position in $TSLA yet ... but interesting to see how the stock got rejected at bear flag resistance today following last week's bounce...  
A few other names showing the beginning phases of Accumulation Volume patterns ....   $AFRM $MDB $APP $MARA   Worth watching how these charts morph, develop and evolve over the next few weeks!  
More Accumulation Volume in $RBLX ... of all the charts I tracked this week, this one was the most compelling  
@ScarlemagneJ 40 is a reasonable price target for now
Nice relative strength in $HRB on this open....  
@MohammedKB24 On this one targeting $40
Three narrow ranged candles in a row for $HRB... look for an expansion move(higher) before the week is out!  
For the first time in a long while, I see a technology stock making the New 52 Week Highs scans!  $JKS  
@aronhicks6 Still not in this $TSLA trade... Waiting for a reversal near resistance(top of the flag pattern)... not quite there yet
@chrisweight $BABA ... even though China names pulled back aggressively today, $BABA made an inside day candle which is technically OK.
$SBLK ... target achieved today.  
Beautiful INSIDE DAY candle in $HRB today(highlighted last week).... Look for an expansion candle move tomorrow!  
$ZIM .... $40 target within fingertips reach now  
$PTEN ... that was quick.   $14 target already hit after barely 2 days  
@aronhicks6 I do see the BEGINNING phases of Acc. Vol in $RBLX  Interesting to see that
@CMegla Stock's industry matters. It has to make sense to own it(or short it) if the fundamentals make sense in whatever the current market environment is. For example, the current market is aggressively selling stocks(techs) that are providing bad guidance.  $HRB upped year end guidance
@teddyboi56 A breakout above $760 in $TSLA would change the chart
$WEAT ... down 9 days in a row and now looks headed to $8(second target).   Gotta say, I was a little surprised how quickly this fell! The Double Top was the cue to look at this from short side but it was that LOWER HIGH that formed on June 17th is what really created the setup!  
$TSLA ... seeing a big bear flag building in this one. Each bounce phase in the last few weeks has been weak in nature as Distributions days steadily piling up on the chart.   Will be watching this one next week for one more bounce or gap up open that fades.  Target: $550  
The initial idea to re-enter in $CF after the bounce into resistance was the right idea but my timing on the entry was a day too early!   Still watching this one for another short entry as it continues to struggle pushing thru that thick brick wall.  
Relative strength galore  $HRB  
@MalibuInvest $STNG ... the last one left standing!  Feels like it's topping out here. And a good one for next week
Took 3 or 4 days ... but looks like this $ZIM is finally breaking that bear flag  
$PTEN wasting no time  
$PTEN ... After catching a couple nice long setups in this Energy stock earlier in the year, now seeing a potential SHORT setup building.  First Target $14  ($10 to $11 target, also possible but that might a bit ambitious for my time frame).

Minority shareholders of Revlon say the company’s stock is in the money, if market prices are any indication   
$BP Equilibrium is 1.2005  Short if the open is below 1.2005 and goes offered below the open. Minor support is 1.1968-1.1969  Offers below 1.1969 will run it down to support at 1.1778-1.1781

After one stop out last night right after the open the $ES came right back so we could wake up to $1000 profit. The Gap Higher told us we had to re-enter the trade after it went back above the open.
It looks like we'll be seeing a Gap Higher Open in The $ES and $NQ and $YM. Be long above the open.
Can't get short $ES until it goes offered below 3837.75 or if the AM open is below 3837.75 and goes offered below the open. Look for a run down to CloseThe Gap at 3800
$ES Equilibrium is 3837.75-3850.50  Long if either open is above 3850.50 and goes bid above the open. Minor resistance is 38687.25-3868.50  Bids above 3868.50 should run it up to resistance at 3912.25-3913.25

Look to get long $ES if it goes bid above3835 or if the AM open is above 3835 and goes bid above the open. Look for a run up to 3876-3877 for the first target.
Short $ES if either open is below Equilibrium at  3834.50 and goes offered below the open. Look for a run down to Close The Gap at 3711.75-3719.25
$GC Look for 1693-1694 as the next target. A break of 1693 will send it down to 1537-1538  1818.7-1819.4 X 1791.2-1791.5 RW 1751.6-1551.7 MR Equilibrium: 1734.6 1726-1727 SD 1693.9-1694.8 SD
Look to get long $SQ  Aug Soybean if it goes bid above 1516 4/8
Conditions are ripe for a little pullback in the $EC.  Oversold in all time frames with a Hammer Bottom saying MUST BE LONG when bid above 1.02420 You can't trade without a trade plan. Stack the odds in your favor.
$AD   Previous Day High: .68795 Low: .67960 Close: .68600  73570-73585 RD 72910-72920 RD 70230-70245 RW 69695-69705 RD 68795-68800 MR Equilibrium: 68433 67960-67970 MS 67655-67670 SW
Looking for $AD to run up to the top of the range at the recent highs at 69700 Bids above 69700 will take it to 70725  Offers below 67655 will bring out the sellers taking it a lot lower.
Look to short $CL if it goes offered below 101.26  Minor support is 98.90-98.95
I'm correcting the $CL  I had the wrong equilibrium numbers posted.
$CL Equilibrium is 101.26 long if the open is above 101.26 and goes bid above the open. Minor resistance is 104.48-104.50  bids above 104.50 will bring out the buyers taking it for a nice ride.
Look to get long $JY if it goes bid above .74102  Minor resistance is at .74475-.74480  Above .74480 look for .74855-.74860 as the next stop.
$JY Equilibrium is .74102  Short if the open is below .74102 and goes offered below the open. Minor support is .73890-.73900  Offers below .73890 will take it for a little ride down to .73380-.73390
$GCQ Equilibrium is 1780.1  Short if the open is below 1780.1 and goes offered below the open. Look for a nice run down to 1737-738
And speaking of Gaps...  The $ZC had a real nice Gap and Run today. It takes one good trade a week to make your week...
@BalthazardN RTH was 3774
@BalthazardN Where is there an open at 3813?
The $ES Gap and Run this morning was clearly the way to go. Been saying that for years.
The $ES short was triggered and sold off 50 points right to the next level and more. Offers below 3753 will bring it to fill an imortant Gap at 3711.75-3719.25
It's nice going to bed with a $1,000+ per contract already made and still looking good. It could move 150 points before the next real resistance.
Look to short $ES if it goes offerd below 3801.25 or if the AM open is below 3801.25 and goes offered below them open. Minor support is 3793-3793.75  Below 3793 we should see a break down to the next support at 3741.25-3742.25
$ES Equilibrium is 3801.25-3804.75  Long if either open is above 3804.75 and goes bid above the open. There's a little resistance at 3833-3834. Bids above b3834 will bring out the buyers taking it 100 points higher.
The Gap created in the $ES that formes the Island Bottom two weeks ago is proving to be good support. Let's see a close above yesterday's high and we should see the Upside Gap get filled next week.
The $AD has a Descending Triangle screaming at you to be short when it's offered below 68390.
The $AD The Ausie dollar. Nobody would have thought about trading it but look at what it's doing, just in the last five hours. Offers below 68390 should bring out the big sellers taking it a lot lower.
Look to short $ADU if it goes offered below 68915 or if the open is below 68915 and goes offered below the open. Look for support at 68390-68400.  Offers below 68400 have no real support for a while. RIDE THE WAVE!
$ADU Equilibrium is 68915  Long if the open is above 68915 and goes bid above the open. Minor resistance is 69230-69240. Bids above 69240 will run it up to some resistance at 69980-69990.
$SF Equilibrium is 1.05400  Short if the open is less than 1.05400 and goes offered below the open. Look for some support at 1.04840-1.04850  Offers below 1.04840 will bring out the sellers taking it a lot lower. RIDE THE WAVE!
@stocks331 Friday's high 6/17 was 3711.75  Monday's 6/21 low was 3735.50 followed by Tuesday's 6/22 low at 3719.25 still leaves a gap remaining from 3711.75-3719.25
@stocks331 RTH  6/17-6/21
The $ES is trading in the middle of two Gaps that are about 300 points wide. Last week the weekly Upside Gap was filled and now is back on the way down. My guess the next stop is the Downside Gap at 3711.75-3719.25
Short $AD if the open is below 69302 and goes offered below the open. Look for 69090-69100 as minor support. Offers below 69090 will send it down to some good support at 68390-68400
$AD Equilibrium is 69302  Look to get long if it goes bid above 69302 or the Open is above 69302 and goes bid above the open. Minor resistance is 69700-69701.  Bids above 69701 will take it to 69980-69990.
@stocks331 Both. But it’s more frequent in the RTH
@roxyfit1 I would say break below.
Bearish engulfing candle  on the small $ES rally. Look for the 3805.75-3831 Gap take a run at getting filled.
@stocks331 3959.50-4017.50
The $ES Monthly charts are looking "heavy", the Weekly charts, "heavy".  Five out of the last six months have not looked good and the Weekly officially went to a down trend.
$ES Equilibrium is 3911-3916.75  Short if either open is below 3911 and goes offered below the open. Minor support is 3892-3892.50  Offers below 3892 will take it down to the Support Gap at 3805.75-3831  Offers below 3805.75 will take it to the next Gap.
@aleppik1 @WN22 Canceled
The $ES Weekly Upside Gap was filled last Friday and now the weakness has returned. The Monthly looks weak, the Weekly is running out of steam and the Daily is nearing the top of a Downward Channel and a Resistance Gap.
MUST BUY @WN22 ON A LOWER OPEN, when and if it becomes BID HIGHER THAN THE OPEN. It's way oversold and ripe for a pullback to the 1090s. Be long with bids above 922.

+Initiations 7/11: $BCOR $BYD $HDSN $KTB $SST $STR  . -Initiations 7/11:
$WING - resting after a big runup  
$NFLX - trying again  
$SPX - pop to 4100 coming?  
large caps, mid caps, small caps  
$PTLO - love the food  
$DRIP - attempt #2  
Here are the market's strongest stocks. Most are biotechs.  
$NIO still acting well.  
@jedimarkus77 And now $AMZN
I'm to the point where I have so many decent setups, I'm having a hard time narrowing my list. Maybe I should just buy TQQQ and be done with it.
$PLTR continues to act well. Decent relative strength recently.  
@RyanPierpont $NIO is similar  
$DRIP  
$SPY - the MAs are playing ping pong  
Top Canadian tech stocks. $SHOP $LSPD $MMAT $ANY  
$NIO - was not expecting a moderate gap down  
@paddygg33 I'm long, but I sold calls against the position to buffer a pullback.
$TICK - clearly broke down after the open.  
$SPX - getting rejected by the hourly 200  
$NIO a pullback indeed  
$NIO may need to rest.  
$T
$AAPL
$MRNA
$PINS Elliott Sets Sights On Pinterest - WSJ

It is what it is. The market ate $AAPL 's left hook like a champ.
Linear stocks &gt; choppy stocks. Where a stock has come from &gt; relative strength. Entries matter.
$BTC.X $SOL.X $ETH.X look like they might have a multi-day run.
$LABU was explosive after the entry, it went up +30% from entry in a couple of days.  
$ZM was another one, down 4 days in a row, a pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The entry was once it broke the pattern.   It moved a quick $12 points.  
$SIGA provided a decent set-up and entry and did exactly what you want a swing to do; move immediately.   Entries matter!   22% move in a couple of days.  
Best-performing stocks in the $SPY since 6/8'  $GIS $DRE $CHD $CLX $MNST $LW $DG $VRTX  
Health Information Services best-performing stocks since 6/8;  $CNVY $MSPR $ACCD  $DH  $HCTI $PRVA  
Here are the best-performing biotech stocks since 6/8.  $EVFM  $CLVS $DAWN $BLTE $COGT $REVB  
$XLE (SELECT SECTOR ENERGY) PEAKED ON 6/8/2022.  It is down about -28% from the high.   The best-performing industries since then;  •Biotechnology •Health Information Services •Health Care Plans •Insurance Brokers. •Confectioners  
The top best-perfoming stocks in multiple timeframes (3-MONTHS, 6-MONTHS) went from a bunch of oil stocks to a handful of Chinese names. $FUTU $PDD $TIGR $ATHM $VIPS
Best trades this week; $FNGD $SPXS $QID $DRV $TZA $DUG  Finding Stocks Before They Breakout;  
@IoCuanto How do you figure that (10x), because they are down a bunch?
The commodity set ups are gone. Maybe the China stocks will fill the void. $FUTU $ATHM $TIGR
I took the $SQQQ instead, +9% so far.  
“Many of the stocks that Tiger Global owns have simply been obliterated in the new environment. Peloton is one of the most dramatic examples.”
$SLB almost the entire YTD gain wiped out in 7-days.  
$XLE, $XOP $XES, were the last men standing.
HOLDING ETF’S AS CORE HOLDINGS  
Sometimes all you have to do is look at the inverse ETFs and ask yourself, would I go long this setup?  $SDOW  
$IWM back to June 2018 levels.  
What an about-face.  $SPY $QQQ $SMH gapping below post fed low.
In a very quiet manner, $XES  (OIL &amp;GAS equipment services) is down 19% in the last 6-days.   $XOP -14%.  $XES -13%  
They got them hooked, and they see blood; $MSTR, El Salvador
Maybe we go lower, but you have to ring the register; $SPXS $SQQQ $SDOW  
YTD % CHANGE  $XOP +69.69% $VIX +61.15% $XLE +59.84% $OIH +57.41% $XES +52.68% $CGMFX +10.06% $GLD +2.09%
@Stocktwits $SQQQ
TAP, TAP, TAP, 21-ema broken across the board; $SPY $QQQ $DIA $XLF  A little follow-through instead of a gap-up would be grrrreat.  
@howardlindzon You can argue that the 21-ema on $PYPL has been resistance for 9-months. Now it is above and has been respecting it for a few days. That is a character change.   If you love it, buy it and use a close below its 21-ema as your initial sell stop.  
the tRIGGER for today=through the previous day's high.   $STZ $CVX $ADM $SLCA  Red=initial stop.

Be careful chasing "breakouts" in stocks which have already experienced a significant percentage move.  Esp if those stocks have longer term MAs which are still in decline.  Trade them for what they are, bounces in downtrends
Markets heading for the 3/29 ⚓️VWAP $IWM $QQQ $SPY  getting late for new purchases of ETFs, there are better setups in individual stocks  protect profits, still a bounce in a downtrend  78 min (5 candles/day) upper 15 min lower  
Earnings are due in 7 days in $ENPH and energy is building for a break higher.  Maybe it gets a pre earnings bump and then sell it before earnings report..  no position yet for me  chart from @MarketSmith  
Top chart 78 minute = 5 equal periods/day $SPY $QQQ $IWM above ⚓️VWAP from May low (green) and chewing at horizontal resistance of the last month  IF it can hold gains, the AVWAP from March highs (red) could come into play  bounce in primary downtrend #toughtotrust  
Always be aware of ⚓️VWAP levels from important highs, they often become a place where supply is found  #Bitcoin  $BTC.X  reposted with no chance for asshole comments  
Where has it come from?  129 to 150 +21 or 16% in 4 weeks  Where does it have the potential to go before enough supply is found to become resistance? ⚓️VWAP from the March 29 high right here  Is the risk worth reward for new purchase here? NO  $AAPL  
@OHMYACKIN they dont have the futures on TC2K
@Ryan__Rigg 479.98 ATH 218.26 Covid low  =261.72 move 261.72/2 = 130.86 50% 479.98-130.86 = 349.12 = 50% retracement
@ybhatikar buy them both!
@trader643 @SunriseTrader I'd be careful with both of those, they are both up against the YTD ⚓️VWAP
@SunriseTrader its looking ready for liftoff, as @SirBradford mentioned, it goes ex dividend tmrw so dont be shocked by close to 1.50 lower
@Pres_Elect_Matt careful, right up against ⚓️VWAP from 3/29 high
Looks like a test of the ⚓️VWAP from the recent low is coming, doesn't make it a buy there  $RBLX  
The $SPY $QQQ $IWM pulled back to the rising 5DMA and ⚓️VWAP from last wk gap lower  The primary trend is lower so the burden remains on the buyers.  The best thing the markets can do is to find support in this area to build a higher low on 15 min TF at bottom  
VIDEO 📽️Stock Market Analysis 7/8/22  $SPY $QQQ $IWM $SMH $IBB $XLF $XLE ⚓️VWAP   
@VolatilityVIX Good points but I still think it looks really goofy
VOLQ futures (VLQ at CME) are trading 1.40 BELOW the VOLQ index.  VIX futures (VX at CFE) are trading 0.40 ABOVE the VIX index.    Both expire on the open next Wednesday.  10 VLQ ~ 1 VIX.  Interesting but not a trade recommendation.
Twitter is 51% below its 52-week high.  But Tesla is 43% below its 52-week high.  Nobody is gonna get out of this looking good.
But I want to own TSLA stock because Elon is iconoclastic.  It doesn't show up on the balance sheet and TSLA is getting creamed as he's distracted by Twitter but I feel so special to own any stock he's involved in.  I bet that if we met we'd be best friends.
